Description:
The program will read a text file and count the occurrencies of single words and clusters of 2 and 3 words. The resulting list will be sorted in descending order (highest frequency on top) and saved in a text file.

Instructions: Drag and drop a text file on the program icon. The program will create a sorted occurrencies list, save it into a text file called wordcount.txt and open it automatically.
You can also start the program from command line and use the text file name as an argument.

New in this version:
