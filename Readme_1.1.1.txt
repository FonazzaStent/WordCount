----------------------------------

Description:
The program will read a text file and count the occurrencies of single words and clusters of 2 and 3 words. The resulting list will be sorted in descending order (highest frequency on top) and saved in a text file.

Instructions: Drag and drop a text file on the program icon. The program will create a sorted occurrencies list, save it into a text file called wordcount.txt and open it automatically.
You can also start the program from command line and use the text file name as an argument.

Edit the config.ini file to set minimum occurrencies number:

Row n. 1: minimum occurrencies of single words
Row n. 2: minimum occurrencies of two-word clusters
Row n. 3: minimum occurrencies of three-word clusters

----------------------------------

New in this version:
- the program will now open automatically the word and cluster frequency list.
